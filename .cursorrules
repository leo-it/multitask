# Cursor Rules

## Code Style
- Do not add comments to code unless explicitly requested by the user
- Do not add console.log statements unless explicitly requested by the user
- Write code in English (variables, functions, classes, etc.)
- UI texts should use i18n system (default Spanish)
- Keep code clean and self-documenting

## General Guidelines
- Prefer explicit code over comments
- Remove debug statements before committing
- Focus on clear, readable code structure
